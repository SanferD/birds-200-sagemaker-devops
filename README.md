# birds-200-sagemaker-devops

The goal of this project is to create a system that can identify different bird species using AWS SageMaker. The system will be trained and deployed through a pipeline. Additionally, there will be a webpage where you can upload bird images for detection, and the results will include bounding boxes and labels.

Please note that this project is currently a work in progress. In the exploration folder, you will find IPython notebooks that demonstrate the transformation of the [Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeralakrishna/200-bird-species-with-11788-images) dataset into RecordIO files. These notebooks also cover the training and deployment of the object detection model. The aim is to automate these manual processes using the AWS SageMaker pipeline in the future.
